# TempoAgents
TempoAgents supports simulating large numbers of vehicle and crowd agents, with complex intersection rules and dynamic interactions. It uses [MassEntity](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/mass-entity-in-unreal-engine) to simulate very large numbers of agents simultaneously.

Unfortunately we don't have the necessary content in Tempo right now to do it justice. But we have a plan to add it - check back soon!
